## TODO

They are plenty of TODOs in the codebase.

-[] Most of the TODOs are about replacing reuseable components which can be extracted from apps/extension to libs/shared-components project. For example, the <ProcessingTip/>, <Button/>, <ChainItem/>, etc.

-[] Make common config files reusable in this monorepo, e.g. the tailwindcss config files.
